# basic-stock-analysis
Objective
  This project is looking to show trends of stocks over a period of time. 
Goals
  With a good amount of work done so far, the following things need to be accomplished: A better formatting of the plot that is created through python. This includes the legend of the graph, the overall design and style of the graph, the spacing between points of data, and finally scaling of the graph itself.
Further development:
  This Project is open to alterations. A better version of this project would be having the ability for this code to be able to have dynamic properties: e.g. interaction between a user and the program. It would be nice if this program were able to take in an input of a specific stock or set of stocks names, a start date, an end date, and then the program will give an output of a graph. This would be nice if it was turned into a basic app, but this is up to those willing to collaborate on the project.
