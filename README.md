# basic-stock-analysis
This is a project where the goal is to have a simple stock screening. Development to the project is wanted. 
I am a newbie and have a little bit of skill with python development. I'm looking to take this initial python program and extend it into a larger portfolio program.
Feel free to make edits that are feasible.
